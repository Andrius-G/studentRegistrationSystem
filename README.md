Yet another Java assignment; the end result of multiple all-nighters featuring roughly 2700 lines of delicious spaghetti code.

# Use Instructions

You can either launch the application directly (by opening the `EXE` file) or by launching an applet from the Processing IDE.

If you choose to launch an applet from the Processing IDE, make sure that the variable `developingMode` is set to `true` (otherwise, the applet will attempt to look for assets in the wrong directory).

# Note

There is one extra `java` folder which was too big to upload, so you will likely have to compile the source code yourself to make it appear.

When compiling to an application, make sure that `developingMode` is set to `false` (otherwise, the application will attempt to look for assets in the wrong directory).
